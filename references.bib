               millennia. From hunting and foraging to burning the land to
               farming to industrial agriculture, increasingly intensive human
               use of land has reshaped global patterns of biodiversity,
               ecosystems, landscapes, and climate. This review examines recent
               evidence from archaeology, paleoecology, environmental history,
               and model-based reconstructions that reveal a planet largely
               transformed by land use over more than 10,000 years. Although
               land use has always sustained human societies, its ecological
               consequences are diverse and sometimes opposing, both degrading
               and enriching soils, shrinking wild habitats and shaping novel
               ones, causing extinctions of some species while propagating and
               domesticating others, and both emitting and absorbing the
               greenhouse gases that cause global climate change. By
               transforming Earth's ecology, land use has literally paved the
               way for the Anthropocene. Now, a better future depends on land
               use strategies that can effectively sustain people together with
               the rest of terrestrial nature on Earth's limited land.",

               changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the
               Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other
               ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely
               to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for
               food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research
               Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the
               international community has developed the next generation of
               advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined
               effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel
               emissions) on the carbon–climate system. A new set of historical
               data based on the History of the Global Environment database
               (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future
               (2015–2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is
               required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for
               CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use
               patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from
               the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly
               connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with
               eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The
               harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use
               patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural
               management information, and resulting secondary lands annually,
               while minimizing the differences between the end of the
               historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and
               preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new
               approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now
               provided at higher resolution (0.25∘×0.25∘) over a longer time
               domain (850–2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail
               (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated
               management practices) using more input datasets (including
               Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest
               and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic
               package. The new LUH2 products contain > 50 times the information
               content of the datasets used in CMIP5 and are designed to enable

               without doubt tahrir defters, which can be categorized into three

               historical geographers have hardly engaged in these defters in

               diverse, detailed and suitable for establishing spatial
               distribution, an extremely important aspect of geographical

               blaming the prolonged economic decline of the Middle East on
               cultural factors. At the root of the problem, as they see it,
               were economic institutions rendered inefficient by the religion

               of historical evidence. It concludes that the evidence does not

               dysfunctional Middle Eastern economic system and offers an
               alternative analysis. It shows that empirical evidence ignored by
               the cultural factors argument points to growth promoting

               collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often
               characterize cultures in regions that have historically had
               higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data
               and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of
               individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis:
               the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive
               correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong
               negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain
               significant even when controlling for potential confounding
               variables. These results help to explain the origin of a
               paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously
               undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable
               nature of human societies.",

               (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and
               weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice
               farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China.
               Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms
               because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers
               coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor
               contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of
               reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as
               dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China's
               historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than
               wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and
               urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among
               people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the
               rice-wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in
               rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other
               potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming
               predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world.
               Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative
               thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms.
               This natural test case within China might explain why East
               Asia-historically reliant on rice farming-has tighter social
               norms than the wheat-farming West.",

               democratically elected leaders. Someone from the incumbent
               leadership group replaces him, and the regime persists. Or the
               incumbent leadership group loses control to a different group
               that replaces it with a new autocracy. Much scholarship exists on
               the first kind of transition, but little on transitions from one
               autocracy to another, though they make up about half of all
               regime changes. We introduce a new data set that facilitates the
               investigation of all three kinds of transition. It provides
               transition information for the 280 autocratic regimes in
               existence from 1946 to 2010. The data identify how regimes exit
               power, how much violence occurs during transitions, and whether
               the regimes that precede and succeed them are autocratic. We

               sometimes leads to democracy but often does not, and many other

               countries such as the United States in the past several decades.
               Although differences across societies and changes within
               societies in gender equality have been well documented, the
               causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars have
               posited that such shifts have been driven by specific events
               (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social movements
               (such as feminism and women’s liberation) or general levels of
               social development (for example, modernization theory1). Although
               these factors are likely to have been partly responsible for
               temporal variations in gender equality, they provide fairly
               intermediate explanations void of a comprehensive framework.
               Here, we use an ecological framework to explore the role of key
               ecological dimensions on change in gender equality over time. We
               focus on four key types of ecological threats/affordances that
               have previously been linked to cultural variations in human
               behaviour as potential explanations for cultural change in gender
               equality: infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and
               climatic stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in
               the United States over six decades (1951–2013) are linked to
               reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates of
               infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality. Results
               were robust, holding when we controlled for other ecological
               dimensions and for collectivism and conservative ideological
               identification (indicators of more broadly traditional cultural

  abstract  = "The countries of the world vary in their position along the
               autocracy-democracy continuum of values. Traditionally, scholars
               explain this variation as based on resource distribution and
               disparity among nations. We provide a different framework for
               understanding the autocracy-democracy dimension and related value
               dimensions, one that is complementary (not alternative) to the
               research tradition, but more encompassing, involving both
               evolutionary (ultimate) and proximate causation of the values. We
               hypothesize that the variation in values pertaining to
               autocracy-democracy arises fundamentally out of human (Homo
               sapiens) species-typical psychological adaptation that manifests
               contingently, producing values and associated behaviours that
               functioned adaptively in human evolutionary history to cope with
               local levels of infectious diseases. We test this parasite
               hypothesis of democratization using publicly available data
               measuring democratization, collectivism-individualism, gender
               egalitarianism, property rights, sexual restrictiveness, and
               parasite prevalence across many countries of the world. Parasite
               prevalence across countries is based on a validated index of the
               severity of 22 important human diseases. We show that, as the
               hypothesis predicts, collectivism (hence, conservatism),
               autocracy, women's subordination relative to men's status, and
               women's sexual restrictiveness are values that positively covary,
               and that correspond with high prevalence of infectious disease.
               Apparently, the psychology of xenophobia and ethnocentrism links
               these values to avoidance and management of parasites. Also as
               predicted, we show that the antipoles of each of the above
               values--individualism (hence, liberalism), democracy, and women's
               rights, freedom and increased participation in casual sex--are a
               positively covarying set of values in countries with relatively
               low parasite stress. Beyond the cross-national support for the
               parasite hypothesis of democratization, it is consistent with the
               geographic location at high latitudes (and hence reduced parasite
               stress) of the early democratic transitions in Britain, France
               and the U.S.A. It, too, is consistent with the marked increase in
               the liberalization of social values in the West in the 1950s and
               1960s (in part, the sexual revolution), regions that, a
               generation or two earlier, experienced dramatically reduced
               infectious diseases as a result of antibiotics, vaccinations,
               food- and water-safety practices, and increased sanitation.
               Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation and diffusion of
               innovations (in thought, action and technology) within and among
               regions, which is associated positively with democratization, is
               causally related to parasite stress. Finally, we hypothesize that
               past selection in the context of morbidity and mortality
               resulting from parasitic disease crafted many of the aspects of
               social psychology unique to humans.",

               between wealth inequality and changing institutional structures,

               dataset on individual wealth, however, allow to present a

               information on individual wealth by socio-economic groups, the

               wages in history that has emerged over the past two decades.
               Research has shown that unskilled men's real wages were higher in
               England and the Low Countries than in other parts of Europe and
               Asia from about 1720. Yet 18th‐ and 19th‐century real wages were
               even higher in the northern American colonies than they were in
               the European leaders, while those in Latin America were somewhere
               in the middle of the global wage ladder. This comparative picture
               is drawn on the basis of unskilled male day wages and various
               recent contributions focused on specific countries and time
               periods noting the variation in wage levels and trends for
               different groups of workers across urban and rural areas and
               labor contracts, varying days of labor per year, and the crucial
               and changing contributions of other family members. The latest

               issues into account in a new global comparative picture of

               to as the emergence of 'courtly love'). However, more recent
               works have shown a similar increase in Chinese, Arabic, Persian,
               Indian and Japanese cultures. Why such a convergent evolution in
               very different cultures? Using qualitative and quantitative
               approaches, we leverage literary history and build a database of
               ancient literary fiction for 19 geographical areas and 77
               historical periods covering 3,800 years, from the Middle Bronze
               Age to the Early Modern period. We first confirm that romantic
               elements have increased in Eurasian literary fiction over the
               past millennium, and that similar increases also occurred
               earlier, in Ancient Greece, Rome and Classical India. We then
               explore the ecological determinants of this increase. Consistent
               with hypotheses from cultural history and behavioural ecology, we

               the Islamic world's stagnation and Europe's long-term success are
               specific to each region: any significant positive interaction
               between cities in the two regions hampered by their different
               main religious orientation. Together, the long-term consequences
               of a different choice of main transport mode (camel versus ship)
               and the development of forms of local participative government in
               Europe that made cities less dependent on the state explain why

               level, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of
               mega-cities in the developing world. This has led scholars to
               believe that development and urbanization are not always
               correlated, either across space or over time. In this paper, we
               use historical data at both the country level and city level over
               the five centuries between 1500–2010 to revisit the topic of
               “urbanization without growth” (Fay and Opal, 2000). In
               particular, we first establish that, although urbanization and
               income remain highly correlated within any given year,
               urbanization is 25–30 percentage points higher in 2010 than in
               1500 at every level of income per capita. Second, while
               historically this shift in urbanization rates was more noticeable
               at the upper tail of the income distribution, i.e. for richer
               countries, it is now particularly visible at the lower tail, i.e.
               for poorer countries. Third, these patterns suggest that
               different factors may have explained the shift in different
               periods of time. We use the discussion of these factors as an
               opportunity to provide a survey of the literature and summarize
               our knowledge of what drives the urbanization process over time.",

               Global Environment (HYDE) with estimates of some of the
               underlying demographic and agricultural driving factors.Methods
               Historical population, cropland and pasture statistics are
               combined with satellite information and specific allocation
               algorithms (which change over time) to create spatially explicit
               maps, which are fully consistent on a 5′ longitude/latitude grid
               resolution, and cover the period 10,000 bc to ad 2000.Results
               Cropland occupied roughly less than 1\% of the global ice‐free
               land area for a long time until ad 1000, similar to the area used
               for pasture. In the centuries that followed, the share of global
               cropland increased to 2\% in ad 1700 (c. 3 million km2) and 11\%
               in ad 2000 (15 million km2), while the share of pasture area grew
               from 2\% in ad 1700 to 24\% in ad 2000 (34 million km2) These
               profound land‐use changes have had, and will continue to have,
               quite considerable consequences for global biogeochemical cycles,
               and subsequently global climate change.Main conclusions Some
               researchers suggest that humans have shifted from living in the
               Holocene (emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (humans
               capable of changing the Earth's atmosphere) since the start of
               the Industrial Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and
               magnitude of some historical land‐use changes (e.g. as result of
               the depopulation of Europe due to the Black Death in the 14th
               century and the aftermath of the colonization of the Americas in
               the 16th century) we believe that this point might have occurred
               earlier in time. While there are still many uncertainties and
               gaps in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change)
               in the global biogeochemical cycle, we hope that this database
               can help global (climate) change modellers to close parts of this
               gap.",

               leaders, but empirical research has been limited by the lack of
               systematic data about individual leaders. Archigos is a new
               dataset with information on leaders in 188 countries from 1875 to
               2004. We provide an overview of the main features of this data.
               Archigos specifically identifies the effective leaders of each
               independent state; it codes when and how leaders came into power,
               their age, and their gender, as well as their personal fate one
               year after they lost office. We illustrate the utility of the
               Archigos dataset by demonstrating how leader attributes predict
               other features of interest in International Relations and
               Comparative Politics. Crisis interactions differ depending on
               whether leaders face each other for the first time or have had
               prior interactions. Irregular leader changes can help identify
               political change in autocracies not apparent from data that
               consider only the democratic nature of institutions. Finally,
               transitions to democracy in the third wave are more likely to
               fail in instances where autocratic rulers were punished after
               leaving office. Our examples illustrate new empirical findings
               that simply could not be explored in existing data sources.
               Although selective, our overview demonstrates how Archigos bears
               considerable promise in providing answers to new and old research
               questions and opens up new avenues for research on individual

               growth processes. We find a number of new patterns and trends in

               with decolonialization, as well as evidence of periodicity in
               civil conflict. We develop new measures of civil war intensity
               and impact, and find that conflicts have been generally more
               severe in the 20th than in the 19th century. We also find that
               the frequency-severity distribution of civil war does not appear
               to follow a power-law distribution, unlike data on many other
               types of conflict. Although structural trends suggest an increase

               distance among historical and contemporary independent
               nation-states, we review the utility of space to theory and
               empirical research in international studies. We identify
               weaknesses in existing empirical data on distances and contiguity
               among nations. Categorical data on distance treat proximity as an
               either-or issue and do not permit identifying degree of proximity
               among states. Continuous measures of distances between midpoints,
               such as capital cities, often overstate the actual distances
               between state borders and suffer for large states and irregular
               territories. We outline a new alternative approach, based on
               measuring the minimum distance for pairs of polities in the
               international system, which remedies some of these shortcomings.
               The current implementation of the minimum-distance database
               includes the minimum distances for all polities within 950 km of
               each other from 1875 to the present. We demonstrate the enhanced
               flexibility of the new minimum-distance approach relative to
               existing alternatives. Moreover, we illustrate how variables
               constructed from distance measures, combined with spatial
               statistical techniques, can contribute substantively to
               international relations and cross-national comparative research.
               We demonstrate the importance of dependence among geographical
               neighbors by examining the link between levels of economic wealth
               and prospects for democracy in the context of regional
               interdependence among states.",

               civil war onset have both overaggregated and underaggregated the
               role of ethnicity, by looking at civil war at the country level
               instead of among specific groups and by treating individual
               countries as closed units, ignoring groups' transnational links.
               In this article the authors integrate transnational links into a
               dyadic perspective on conflict between marginalized ethnic groups
               and governments. They argue that transnational links can increase
               the risk of conflict as transnational kin support can facilitate
               insurgencies and are difficult for governments to target or
               deter. The empirical analysis, using new geocoded data on ethnic
               groups on a transnational basis, indicates that the risk of
               conflict is high when large, excluded ethnic groups have
               transnational kin in neighboring countries, and it provides
               strong support for the authors' propositions on the importance of
