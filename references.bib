              and hate groups, evoking images of Nazi-Germany and the rise of
              fascism. The geographic association between hate groups and hate
              crimes is uncertain. In this research we ask whether hate crimes
              are co-located and correlated to the presence of hate groups to
              explore a potential association between these two phenomena.
              Publicly available point level data on hate crimes and hate groups
              collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) were
              aggregated to unitary framework of hexagonal grid cells of a
              Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) at multiple scales for
              consistent analysis. We explore the effects of proximity by
              interpreting a co-location map, deploying a Geographically
              Weighted Regression (GWR) for count data, and apply a Spatial Lag
              Model (SLM) at multiple scales, to ascertain the effects of the
              size of the aggregation units on the relationship between hate
              groups and hate crimes. Controlled or uncontrolled for spatial
              dependence, at all scales, the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) shows that
              an average of 39.5\% of the hate crimes was correlated with hate
              groups. These results are consistent with the existing research
              but show that in most instances spatial dependence was present,
              regardless of the size of the aggregation unit or the distance to

               function. One broad implication is the existence of
               cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour
               contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local
               ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural
               variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist
               values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of
               collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the
               transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that
               collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often
               characterize cultures in regions that have historically had
               higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data
               and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of
               individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis:
               the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive
               correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong
               negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain
               significant even when controlling for potential confounding
               variables. These results help to explain the origin of a

               weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice
               farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China.
               Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms
               because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers
               coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor
               contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of
               reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as
               dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China's
               historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than
               wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and
               urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among
               people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the
               rice-wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in
               rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other
               potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming
               predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world.
               Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative
               thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms.
               This natural test case within China might explain why East
               Asia-historically reliant on rice farming-has tighter social
               norms than the wheat-farming West.",

               countries such as the United States in the past several decades.
               Although differences across societies and changes within
               societies in gender equality have been well documented, the
               causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars have
               posited that such shifts have been driven by specific events
               (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social movements
               (such as feminism and women’s liberation) or general levels of
               social development (for example, modernization theory1). Although
               these factors are likely to have been partly responsible for
               temporal variations in gender equality, they provide fairly
               intermediate explanations void of a comprehensive framework.
               Here, we use an ecological framework to explore the role of key
               ecological dimensions on change in gender equality over time. We
               focus on four key types of ecological threats/affordances that
               have previously been linked to cultural variations in human
               behaviour as potential explanations for cultural change in gender
               equality: infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and
               climatic stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in
               the United States over six decades (1951–2013) are linked to
               reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates of
               infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality. Results
               were robust, holding when we controlled for other ecological
               dimensions and for collectivism and conservative ideological
               identification (indicators of more broadly traditional cultural
               norms and attitudes). Furthermore, the effects were partially
               mediated by reduced teenage birth rates (a sign that people are
               adopting slower life history strategies), suggesting that life
               history strategies statistically account for the relationship
               between pathogen prevalence and gender inequality over time.

  abstract  = "The countries of the world vary in their position along the
               autocracy-democracy continuum of values. Traditionally, scholars
               explain this variation as based on resource distribution and
               disparity among nations. We provide a different framework for
               understanding the autocracy-democracy dimension and related value
               dimensions, one that is complementary (not alternative) to the
               research tradition, but more encompassing, involving both
               evolutionary (ultimate) and proximate causation of the values. We
               hypothesize that the variation in values pertaining to
               autocracy-democracy arises fundamentally out of human (Homo
               sapiens) species-typical psychological adaptation that manifests
               contingently, producing values and associated behaviours that
               functioned adaptively in human evolutionary history to cope with
               local levels of infectious diseases. We test this parasite
               hypothesis of democratization using publicly available data
               measuring democratization, collectivism-individualism, gender
               egalitarianism, property rights, sexual restrictiveness, and
               parasite prevalence across many countries of the world. Parasite
               prevalence across countries is based on a validated index of the
               severity of 22 important human diseases. We show that, as the
               hypothesis predicts, collectivism (hence, conservatism),
               autocracy, women's subordination relative to men's status, and
               women's sexual restrictiveness are values that positively covary,
               and that correspond with high prevalence of infectious disease.
               Apparently, the psychology of xenophobia and ethnocentrism links
               these values to avoidance and management of parasites. Also as
               predicted, we show that the antipoles of each of the above
               values--individualism (hence, liberalism), democracy, and women's
               rights, freedom and increased participation in casual sex--are a
               positively covarying set of values in countries with relatively
               low parasite stress. Beyond the cross-national support for the
               parasite hypothesis of democratization, it is consistent with the
               geographic location at high latitudes (and hence reduced parasite
               stress) of the early democratic transitions in Britain, France
               and the U.S.A. It, too, is consistent with the marked increase in
               the liberalization of social values in the West in the 1950s and
               1960s (in part, the sexual revolution), regions that, a
               generation or two earlier, experienced dramatically reduced
               infectious diseases as a result of antibiotics, vaccinations,
               food- and water-safety practices, and increased sanitation.
               Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation and diffusion of
               innovations (in thought, action and technology) within and among
               regions, which is associated positively with democratization, is
               causally related to parasite stress. Finally, we hypothesize that
               past selection in the context of morbidity and mortality
               resulting from parasitic disease crafted many of the aspects of
               social psychology unique to humans.",

               product of social change. The Code recognized private property on
               land, enlarged liberties of landholders, and pushed inheritance
               rules further towards gender equality. Deeply influenced by the
               uneven development of the capitalist relations of production,
               agrarian conflict, and the complex matrix of the interests of
               ruling groups, Ottoman land law in the nineteenth century
               unmistakably evolved in the direction of modern law based on the
               abstract individual and full commodification of land.",

               Early Modern European period (a phenomenon that was once referred
               to as the emergence of 'courtly love'). However, more recent
               works have shown a similar increase in Chinese, Arabic, Persian,
               Indian and Japanese cultures. Why such a convergent evolution in
               very different cultures? Using qualitative and quantitative
               approaches, we leverage literary history and build a database of
               ancient literary fiction for 19 geographical areas and 77
               historical periods covering 3,800 years, from the Middle Bronze
               Age to the Early Modern period. We first confirm that romantic
               elements have increased in Eurasian literary fiction over the
               past millennium, and that similar increases also occurred
               earlier, in Ancient Greece, Rome and Classical India. We then
               explore the ecological determinants of this increase. Consistent
               with hypotheses from cultural history and behavioural ecology, we
               show that a higher level of economic development is strongly
               associated with a greater incidence of love in narrative fiction
               (our proxy for the importance of love in a culture). To further
               test the causal role of economic development, we used a
               difference-in-difference method that exploits exogenous regional
               variations in economic development resulting from the adoption of
               the heavy plough in medieval Europe. Finally, we used

               specific to each region: any significant positive interaction

               frequency of intergroup conflicts. In addition, social rewards

               level, and there has been a dramatic increase in the number of
               mega-cities in the developing world. This has led scholars to
               believe that development and urbanization are not always
               correlated, either across space or over time. In this paper, we
               use historical data at both the country level and city level over
               the five centuries between 1500–2010 to revisit the topic of
               “urbanization without growth” (Fay and Opal, 2000). In
               particular, we first establish that, although urbanization and
               income remain highly correlated within any given year,
               urbanization is 25–30 percentage points higher in 2010 than in
               1500 at every level of income per capita. Second, while
               historically this shift in urbanization rates was more noticeable
               at the upper tail of the income distribution, i.e. for richer
               countries, it is now particularly visible at the lower tail, i.e.
               for poorer countries. Third, these patterns suggest that
               different factors may have explained the shift in different
               periods of time. We use the discussion of these factors as an
               opportunity to provide a survey of the literature and summarize
               our knowledge of what drives the urbanization process over time.",

               c.1790-1910. It identifies a theoretical weakness in the

               procession and protest in symbolically ordering the built
               environment too often serves to represent it as intrinsically
               un-ordered and lacking in definition. The effect, it is argued,
               has been to present symbolic regimes, particularly those of local
               elites, as something imposed on rather than, in any sense arising
               from quotidian urban performance and to artificially isolate

               rebalance the prevailing cultural perspective, which views maps
               as ideological representations, with an analytical approach that
               emphasizes maps as sources for understanding space and spatial
               relationships embedded in built forms. The quantitative
               descriptions of urban street networks produced by space syntax
               analyses can be used to formulate and test hypotheses about
               patterns of urban movement, encounter and socio-economic activity
               in the past that can help in the interpretation of other
               historical source materials to give an overall account of urban
               spatial culture. In this article, the authors explain how space
               syntax, a theory and method originally developed in the field of
               architectural research, is making a distinctive contribution to
               research in social and urban history. The key principles of the
               method are explained by clarifying the relationship of space
               syntax to HGIS (Historical Geographical Information Systems) and
               through a worked example of research undertaken into political
               meeting places. A survey of research into the urban history of
               the nineteenth-century city using space syntax is used to

               datasets which remedy both these temporal and geographic

               leaders, but empirical research has been limited by the lack of
               systematic data about individual leaders. Archigos is a new
               dataset with information on leaders in 188 countries from 1875 to
               2004. We provide an overview of the main features of this data.
               Archigos specifically identifies the effective leaders of each
               independent state; it codes when and how leaders came into power,
               their age, and their gender, as well as their personal fate one
               year after they lost office. We illustrate the utility of the
               Archigos dataset by demonstrating how leader attributes predict
               other features of interest in International Relations and
               Comparative Politics. Crisis interactions differ depending on
               whether leaders face each other for the first time or have had
               prior interactions. Irregular leader changes can help identify
               political change in autocracies not apparent from data that
               consider only the democratic nature of institutions. Finally,
               transitions to democracy in the third wave are more likely to
               fail in instances where autocratic rulers were punished after
               leaving office. Our examples illustrate new empirical findings
               that simply could not be explored in existing data sources.
               Although selective, our overview demonstrates how Archigos bears
               considerable promise in providing answers to new and old research

               growth processes. We find a number of new patterns and trends in

               civil conflict. We develop new measures of civil war intensity
               and impact, and find that conflicts have been generally more
               severe in the 20th than in the 19th century. We also find that
               the frequency-severity distribution of civil war does not appear
               to follow a power-law distribution, unlike data on many other

               The ansatz includes computing the residuals to an optimized

               underlying periodic structures using a truncated Fourier sine

               weaknesses in existing empirical data on distances and contiguity
               among nations. Categorical data on distance treat proximity as an
               either-or issue and do not permit identifying degree of proximity
               among states. Continuous measures of distances between midpoints,
               such as capital cities, often overstate the actual distances
               between state borders and suffer for large states and irregular
               territories. We outline a new alternative approach, based on
               measuring the minimum distance for pairs of polities in the
               international system, which remedies some of these shortcomings.
               The current implementation of the minimum-distance database
               includes the minimum distances for all polities within 950 km of
               each other from 1875 to the present. We demonstrate the enhanced
