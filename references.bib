              crimes is uncertain. In this research we ask whether hate crimes
              are co-located and correlated to the presence of hate groups to
              explore a potential association between these two phenomena.
              Publicly available point level data on hate crimes and hate groups
              collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) were
              aggregated to unitary framework of hexagonal grid cells of a
              Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) at multiple scales for
              consistent analysis. We explore the effects of proximity by
              interpreting a co-location map, deploying a Geographically
              Weighted Regression (GWR) for count data, and apply a Spatial Lag
              Model (SLM) at multiple scales, to ascertain the effects of the
              size of the aggregation units on the relationship between hate
              groups and hate crimes. Controlled or uncontrolled for spatial
              dependence, at all scales, the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) shows that
              an average of 39.5\% of the hate crimes was correlated with hate
              groups. These results are consistent with the existing research
              but show that in most instances spatial dependence was present,

               mobility, fostered greater individualism, less conformity, and

               function. One broad implication is the existence of
               cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour
               contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local
               ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural
               variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist
               values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of
               collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the
               transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that
               collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often

               higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data
               and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of
               individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis:
               the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive

               negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain

               (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and
               weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice
               farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China.
               Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms
               because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers
               coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor
               contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of
               reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as
               dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China's
               historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than
               wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and
               urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among
               people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the
               rice-wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in
               rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other
               potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming
               predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world.
               Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative
               thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms.
               This natural test case within China might explain why East
               Asia-historically reliant on rice farming-has tighter social
               norms than the wheat-farming West.",

               countries such as the United States in the past several decades.
               Although differences across societies and changes within
               societies in gender equality have been well documented, the
               causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars have
               posited that such shifts have been driven by specific events
               (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social movements
               (such as feminism and women’s liberation) or general levels of
               social development (for example, modernization theory1). Although
               these factors are likely to have been partly responsible for
               temporal variations in gender equality, they provide fairly
               intermediate explanations void of a comprehensive framework.
               Here, we use an ecological framework to explore the role of key
               ecological dimensions on change in gender equality over time. We
               focus on four key types of ecological threats/affordances that
               have previously been linked to cultural variations in human
               behaviour as potential explanations for cultural change in gender
               equality: infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and
               climatic stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in
               the United States over six decades (1951–2013) are linked to
               reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates of
               infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality. Results
               were robust, holding when we controlled for other ecological
               dimensions and for collectivism and conservative ideological
               identification (indicators of more broadly traditional cultural
               norms and attitudes). Furthermore, the effects were partially
               mediated by reduced teenage birth rates (a sign that people are
               adopting slower life history strategies), suggesting that life
               history strategies statistically account for the relationship
               between pathogen prevalence and gender inequality over time.
               Finally, we replicated our key effects in a different society,
               using comparable data from the United Kingdom over a period of
               seven decades (1945–2014).",

               evolutionary (ultimate) and proximate causation of the values. We
               hypothesize that the variation in values pertaining to
               autocracy-democracy arises fundamentally out of human (Homo
               sapiens) species-typical psychological adaptation that manifests
               contingently, producing values and associated behaviours that
               functioned adaptively in human evolutionary history to cope with
               local levels of infectious diseases. We test this parasite
               hypothesis of democratization using publicly available data
               measuring democratization, collectivism-individualism, gender
               egalitarianism, property rights, sexual restrictiveness, and
               parasite prevalence across many countries of the world. Parasite
               prevalence across countries is based on a validated index of the
               severity of 22 important human diseases. We show that, as the
               hypothesis predicts, collectivism (hence, conservatism),
               autocracy, women's subordination relative to men's status, and
               women's sexual restrictiveness are values that positively covary,
               and that correspond with high prevalence of infectious disease.
               Apparently, the psychology of xenophobia and ethnocentrism links
               these values to avoidance and management of parasites. Also as
               predicted, we show that the antipoles of each of the above
               values--individualism (hence, liberalism), democracy, and women's
               rights, freedom and increased participation in casual sex--are a
               positively covarying set of values in countries with relatively
               low parasite stress. Beyond the cross-national support for the
               parasite hypothesis of democratization, it is consistent with the
               geographic location at high latitudes (and hence reduced parasite
               stress) of the early democratic transitions in Britain, France
               and the U.S.A. It, too, is consistent with the marked increase in
               the liberalization of social values in the West in the 1950s and
               1960s (in part, the sexual revolution), regions that, a
               generation or two earlier, experienced dramatically reduced
               infectious diseases as a result of antibiotics, vaccinations,
               food- and water-safety practices, and increased sanitation.
               Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation and diffusion of
               innovations (in thought, action and technology) within and among
               regions, which is associated positively with democratization, is
               causally related to parasite stress. Finally, we hypothesize that
               past selection in the context of morbidity and mortality
               resulting from parasitic disease crafted many of the aspects of
               social psychology unique to humans.",

               we analyse the dynamic economic and political impact of an
               economic sanction. Our theoretical analysis of the dynamics of
               adjustment gives us two important results: firstly, the strongest
               impact in terms of utility forgone occurs in the initial phase of
               the sanction episode and, secondly, the long-term gain of
               compliance decreases during a sanction episode and is lower in
               the long run than acknowledged by the usual comparative static
               analysis. On both accounts we expect that sanctions have a higher
               probability of success in the early phase and a lower probability
               of success in the long run. Next we build a comprehensive set of
               vector autoregressive (VAR) models that we apply to the case of a
               boycott of Iranian oil. An important innovation is that we
               include both economic and political factors in a VAR model of
               economic sanctions. Our VAR models find significant impacts of
               economic sanctions both on key economic variables (government
               consumption, imports, investment, income) and on two indicators
               of the political system (the Polity variable that describes
               shifts in the autocracy?democracy dimension and the Vanhanen
               Index of Democratization that describes political competition and
               participation). The impact of an oil boycott on the Iranian
               economy is considerable: oil and gas rents are important drivers
               of the Iranian key macroeconomic variables and ultimately of its
               political system. A reduction of oil and gas rents creates
               economic costs that act as incentives to move towards a more
               democratic setting. However, this effect is only significant in
               the first two years and turns negative after six to seven years,
               as adjustment of economic structures mitigates the economic and
               political impact of the sanctions.",

               ancient literary fiction for 19 geographical areas and 77
               historical periods covering 3,800 years, from the Middle Bronze

               1800, the urban center of gravity moved from the Islamic world to
               Europe. Using a large new city-specific data set covering Europe,
               the Middle East, and North Africa, we unravel the role of
               geography and institutions in determining long-run city
               development in the two regions. We find that the main reasons for
               the Islamic world's stagnation and Europe's long-term success are
               specific to each region: any significant positive interaction
               between cities in the two regions hampered by their different
               main religious orientation. Together, the long-term consequences
               of a different choice of main transport mode (camel versus ship)
               and the development of forms of local participative government in
               Europe that made cities less dependent on the state explain why
               Europe's urban development eventually outpaced that in the
               Islamic world.",

               186 mainly preindustrial societies from all over the world. The
               analysis demonstrated that honor culture, which values males’
               toughness and aggression, has a positive relationship with
               frequency of intergroup conflicts. In addition, social rewards
               (praise, prestige, and status) for warriors mediated the
               relationship between honor culture and frequency of intergroup
               conflict. These results imply that the collective-level processes
               of honor culture enhance intergroup conflicts through the social
               reputations of warriors who participate in war.",
